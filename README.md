### About this project
I came up with the idea of creating this page in order to have organised all the aspects I need to have handy in my everyday basis. I want to build-up all the theory and used tools related to topics that I learn when practicing pentesting on sites like TryHackMe or HackTheBox. I think that it is also interesting to have a frecuently used resources list and a section for FAQ in job interviews.  

### About me
I’m a Computer Scientist graduated from the University of the Basque Country (UPV-EHU), now studying a Msc in Cybersecurity by the University Carlos III of Madrid (UC3M). I’m passionate about computer networks, Linux, programming, robotics and especially cybersecurity; during the last years I've been working with dockers, linux, virtual machines and networks, pentesting tools, etc. In my free time I like exploring new computer features, playing in Hack The Box and Try Hack Me, reading news (not only about computer science), playing chess, cooking and traveling when I can.
